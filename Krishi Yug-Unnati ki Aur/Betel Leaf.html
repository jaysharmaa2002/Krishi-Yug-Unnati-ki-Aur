 <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Betel Leaf</strong>- 
Paan is a perennial vine, which is used in our country for worship as well as in food. There is such a popular belief that eating betel leaves the mouth pure, betel cultivation has been done in India since ancient times. 
<br><br>It is known as Nagaballi in Sanskrit, Tambul in Hindi-speaking regions as Paan/Nagurbeli in Marathi, Paan/Nagurbeli in Gujarati, Bettilai in Tamil, Tamalpaku in Telugu, Killi, Vilayadeli in Kannada and Malayalam.
She is called by the name Betilai. Betel is also successfully cultivated in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Papua, New Guinea etc.
<br><br>
In India betel leaf is known as "paan" and betel leaves are dark green in color which are heart shaped which are widely used in India and scientific name of betel is Piper Beetle . Paan belongs to the family of Piperaceae. There are more than 90 varieties of betel nut in the world, of which about 45 are found in India and 30 in West Bengal.
<br><br>
Paan is grown in the tropics and subtropics for its evergreen leaves that are used in worship/religious events and as a chewing stimulant.The betel (Piper betle) is a vine of the family Piperaceae, which includes pepper and kava. Betel leaf is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel quid or in paan, with areca nut and/or tobacco.In India and Sri Lanka, a sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings in traditional Indian culture Occasions include greeting elders at wedding ceremonies, celebrating the New Year, and offering payment to physicians and astrologers (to whom money and/or areca nut, placed on top of the sheaf of leaves, are offered in thanks for blessings).

<div class="container">
	  






<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Local Names of Paan in India</strong>

Tamalpaku (Telugu), Vetrilai (Tamil), Kavala (Kannada), Bida/Paan (Hindi), Vidyache Paan, Naginich Paan (Marathi), Vetila (Malayalam). Paan (Bengali), Tamul (Assamese), Nagarvel na Paan (Gujarati).
</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Medicinal properties of betel leaves</strong>

Paan has been used since ancient times due to its medicinal properties. According to the book Sushruta Samhita of Ayurveda, betel cures sore throat and sore throat. It enhances digestion power by removing bad odor from the mouth, while the paste of crushed fresh leaves prevents decomposition of cuts and wounds.
</p>










<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Botanical description</strong>
Betel is a Latabergian plant, whose roots are short and sparsely branched. Whereas the stem is thin and branchless with long tips, broad leaves. Its leaves have high amount of chloroplasts. 5-8 cm long, 6-12 cm small glutinous roots emerge around the green stem of the betel, which is helpful in climbing the vine.
</p>













<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Major species of betel</strong>
The species which are mainly used in North India are as follows- Native, Deshavari, Calcutta, Kapoori, Bangla, Saunfia, Ramtek, Maghai, Banarasi etc.
</p>










<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Betel cultivation method</strong>
Traction activities for betel cultivation in North India start after 15th January. For good cultivation of betel leaves, deep plowing of the land is done and the land is left open. After that two shallow plowing is done, then Bareja is made. This process is completed by 15-20 February. For good cultivation it is necessary to keep proper distance from row to row. For this, the row-to-row distance is kept 30X30 cm or 45X45 cm as required.
</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Land purification</strong>

In order to destroy the bacteria and mold affecting the betel crop, it is necessary to purify the soil before planting the betel leaf.
</p>







<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Treatment of Cuttings</strong>
Betel cuttings require treatment at the time of transplanting as well as at the time of propagation. For this, even before sowing, 500 ppm streptomycin is used with 50 percent Borda mixture to treat the soil. After that, even before sowing, the above mixture is used to protect the vines from fungus and bacteria.
</p>










<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Give support</strong>

This is an important task for betel cultivation. When the betel cuttings are 6 weeks old, they are raised up the vines using bamboo sticks, linen or jute sticks. After 7-8 weeks, the cutting leaves are separated from the vines, which is called "Pedi's Paan". It has a special demand in the market and its price is also higher than normal betel leaves. Thus, after 10-12 weeks, when the betel vines are 1.5-2 feet tall, the plucking of betel leaves is started.When the vines reach 2.5-3 m or 8-10 ft, the vines are revived to develop their production capacity. For this, 8-10 months old vines are wrapped in the form of rings of 15-20 cm diameter, leaving 0.5-7.5 cm from the top and keep them near the root of the support and partially buried with the soil and do light irrigation. Huh.
</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Climate</strong>
Climatic conditions are an important factor for good betel cultivation. In this, proper temperature, humidity, light and shade, air condition, soil etc. are important factors for the cultivation of betel leaves.
</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Various factors of climate are required for optimum cultivation of betel. The details of which are given below-</strong>
<br>
<b>1. Temperature:</b> The betel vine is very sensitive to temperature. The best development of betel vine is in those areas where the change in temperature is moderate and minimal. The optimum temperature for betel cultivation is 28-35 degree Celsius.
<br>
<b>2. Light and shade:</b> Good light and good shade are required for the cultivation of betel leaves. Generally betel cultivation requires 40-50% shade and a long period of light.
<br>
<b>3. Humidity:</b>Good humidity is required for good betel cultivation. It is noteworthy that the growth of betel vine is maximum during the rainy season, mainly due to good humidity. In conditions of good humidity, there is good circulation of nutrients in the leaves.
<br>
<b>4. Wind:</b> It should be noted that the speed of air is the main factor affecting the rate of evaporation. While dry winds cause damage for betel cultivation, moist and humid winds are very beneficial for betel cultivation during the rainy season.
<br>
<b>5. Soil: </b>For good cultivation of betel, fertile soil containing fine humus is very beneficial. By the way, betel cultivation is done successfully in sandy, loamy, red and alubial soils and laterite soils in different areas of the country. For betel cultivation, fields with proper drainage are required.

</p>







<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Farm preparation</strong>

For good cultivation of betel leaves, deep plowing of the land is done and the land is left open. After that two shallow plowing is done, then Bareja is made. This process is completed by 15-20 February.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Fertilizers and Chemical Fertilizers</strong>
Fertilizers are often used in betel cultivation to ensure that betel vines get good nutrients. Organic ingredients are often used in betel cultivation. In North India, mustard, sesame, neem or egg cakes are used, which are given at an interval of 15 days in July-October. A small amount of urea is also used along with cakes during the rainy season.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Major diseases:</strong><br>
<b>(1) Foliage / rot disease:</b>This is a fungal disease, the main factor of which is "Phytophthora parasitica". Due to its use, dark brown spots are formed on the leaves, which remain even after the end of the rainy season. They cause great damage to the fruit.<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>->Disease-borne plants should be uprooted and completely destroyed.
<br>->Irrigation is the main factor of this disease. Therefore, pure water should be used.
<br>->Bordeaux mixture or blightax with 0.5 percent concentration should be used during the rainy season.

<br><br>

<b>(2) Tanglan disease:</b>This is also a fungal disease, the main factor of which is a fungus named "Phytophthora parasitica" called piperina. Due to this rotting starts at the base of the vines. Due to its wrath, the plants wither and die in a short time.
<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>->Proper arrangement for drainage should be made in barges.
<br>->Diseased plants should be uprooted and destroyed.
<br>->Build Bareja at the new location.
<br>->Before sowing, land should be treated with Bordeaux mixture.
<br>If disease symptoms appear on the crop, spray 0.5 percent Bordeaux mixture.

<br><br>

<b>(3) Cervical rot or goiter disease:</b> This is also a fungal disease, the main factor of which is a fungus called "Sclerocium selfsii". Due to its infestation, deep wounds develop in the vines, the leaves turn yellow and the crop is destroyed.
<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>->The disease-borne vine should be uprooted and completely destroyed.
<br>->TBefore sowing the crop, land should be purified.
<br>->TSpraying of 0.5 percent solution of Dithane M.-45 should be done for prevention of infestation on the crop.


<br><br>

<b>(4) Foliage / stem black color disease:</b> This is also a fungal disease, the main factor of which is "Collettotrichum catcci". Its infection can occur on any part of the stem. Initially, it appears as small black spots, which spread further after getting moisture. This also causes great damage to the crop.
<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>->0.5 percent Bordeaux mixture should be used.
<br>->Spraying of Sesopar or Bavestein should be done.

<br><br>

<b>(5) Complete Asthma or;Cucumberal Dipsakumuddha Disease:</b> This is also a fungal disease, the main factor of which is disease caused by "Idium piperis". In this, initially small white to brown powdery spots appear on the leaves. They cause great damage to the crop.
<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>
<br>->After the outbreak is visible on the crop, spraying of 0.5% solution should be done.
<br>->Casein or colloidal sulfur should be used.

<br><br>

<b>(6) Bacterial diseases:</b> Due to bacterial diseases in the betel crop, the crop also suffers a lot. The main bacterial diseases caused by betel leaves are:-<br>
<br>
<b>(a)- Leaf spot or leaf spot disease:</b> Its main factor is "Pseudomodas bacillus". After its outbreak, the symptoms appear as follows. In this, brown round or angular spots appear on the leaves, due to which the plant is destroyed.
<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b><br>
For its control, "Phytomycin and Agromycin-100" should be used with glycerin.
<br>
<b>(b) - Stem cancer:</b> It appears on the stem in the form of brown spots in length. As a result, the stem bursts.<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b><br>
->For its control, a solution of 150 grams of planto bicine and 150 grams of copper sulphate should be mixed in 600 liters and sprayed.
<br>
->0.5 percent Bordeaux mixture should be sprayed.

<br><br>

<b>(c)- Leaf blight:</b> Due to this infestation brown or black spots are formed on the leaves, which causes scorching of the leaves.<br>
<b>Prevention Measures:</b>
<br>->For its control, spray of Streptocyclin 200 ppm or 0.25 percent Bordeaux mixture should be done.

<br><br>


</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Betel cultivation is prone to many types of pests, due to which the production of betel is affected. Following are the details of the major pests affecting the betel crop:</strong>
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>(1.) Bittlebean Bug:</strong>
 Appearing between June and October, this insect feeds on betel leaves and makes explosive holes on the leaves. It feeds on the tissue between the betel veins, causing wilting or shrinking of the leaves and eventually drying of the vine.
Treatment: For its control, a solution of tobacco root should be prepared by preparing a solution of 01 liter solution in 20 liters of water. Endosulfan or malathion with 0.04 percent concentration should be used.
</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>(2.) Mealy bug: </strong>
It is a light colored oval shaped insect 5 cm in length, which is covered with white powdery sheath. They occur in groups and lay eggs on the underside of betel leaves, on which their life cycle goes. Their maximum outbreak occurs during the rainy season. This causes great damage to the betel crop.
Treatment: Spraying of Malathion solution with 0.03-0.05 percent concentration should be done to control it.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>(3.) White fly:</strong>
This insect appears on betel leaves from October to March with a size of 1-1.5 mm. length and 0.5-1 mm. The width is conical. This insect eats the lower surface of the new leaves of betel leaves, which affects the entire vine. Due to its infestation, the growth of betel vine stops and the leaves become colorless and become useless.
Treatment: For its control, spraying of 0.02% disease or Demokron should be done on the leaves.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>(4.)Red and Black Ants:</strong>
These are brownish red or black colored ants, which damage betel leaves and vines. Inak outbreak occurs when it attacks after the outbreak of mahu to get the honey emitted from them.
Control and treatment: To control them, 0.02 percent Demokron or 0.5 percent malathion should be used.

</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>(5.) Nematodes:</strong>
 There is also an outbreak of nematodes in betel leaves. They do the most damage to the root and cuttings of betel vine.
<br>
Control and treatment: Carvofuram and neemkhali should be used to control them. The dosage is as follows: Carbofuram 1.5 kg. copy is. Or 0.75 kg in 0.5 tonne of Neemkhali. A mixture of Carvofuram should be prepared and used in betel cultivation.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Irrigation and Drainage System</strong>
In North India irrigation is required three to four times per day (in summer) two to three times in winters. Good drainage system is also necessary for betel cultivation. Excess moisture causes rotting of betel roots, affecting production. Therefore, sloping place is best for betel cultivation.
</p>






<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Weed Control and Weeding</strong>
For good production in betel cultivation, weeding and hoeing is required from time to time. Unnecessary weeds should be removed from the barges from time to time. Similarly, between shifts in September-October, hoeing the soil with a spade is 40-50 cm. Make maids at a distance and offer soil as needed.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Method of use</strong>

The cake is powdered and soaked in an earthen pot and allowed to decompose for 10 days. After that, it is made into a solution and given on the roots of the vine.<br>
<b>Quantity:</b> Per. 02 tonnes of oil cake is used for the cultivation of betel throughout the season. It is noteworthy that copy. Requirement of betel vine Nitrogen: Phosphorus:Potassium ratio 80:14:100 kg respectively. Which is made available to the betel vines using the said cake.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Note</strong>
<br>1. For the proper growth and development of betel vines, micro elements and growth regulators are also used.
<br>2. For land purification, use 1% concentration of Bordeaux mixture and after the end of the rainy season, again use Bordeaux mixture (0.5 percent concentration) on betel vines.
</p>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Method for preparing Bordeaux mixture</strong>
01 kg Lime (slaked lime) and 01 kg. Tutiya (soil) 10-10 liters in 2 separate pots. Prepare the solution by soaking it in water, then in another earthen vessel, drop both the solutions on the wooden edge in such a way that the edges of both fall together. The solution thus prepared is Bordeaux mixture. This 20 lit. In the mixture 80 l. Mix 100 liters of it with water. Prepare the solution and use it in betel cultivation
</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Use of clay</strong>
The roots of betel vine are very tender, which cannot tolerate excessive heat and cold. Clay is used to cover the roots of betel leaves. Black soil is used in June, July and red mud in October, November.
