          <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Rice</strong>is a major crop from which rice is extracted. It is the staple food of many countries of Asia and the world including India. Paddy is the second largest grain produced in the world after maize. Paddy or rice is the most important food crop of India. Which covers one fourth of the total cropped area. Paddy or rice is the food of almost half the Indian population.
<br>
Rather it is eaten mainly by a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural food crop with the third highest worldwide production after sugarcane and maize. Paddy is one of the oldest known crops, it was grown in the largest form in China about 5000 years ago. Paddy in India in 3000 BC. I was searched. This discovery was not made by any scientist but by farmers and native people.
<br>
Paddy Cultivating Countries and Regions- Paddy is successfully grown in regions with warmer climates. Most of the world's rice is produced in Southeast Asia. China, Japan, India, Indochina, Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are the major rice producing countries.
<br>
Paddy is also cultivated in a wide area in Italy, Egypt, and Spain. Paddy is cultivated in almost all the states in India, but the major producing states are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh.Rice can be cultivated by different methods based on the type of region. But in India, traditional methods are still in use for harvesting rice. The fields are initially plowed and fertilizer is applied which typically consists of cow dung, and then the field is smoothed. The seeds are transplanted by hand and then through proper irrigation, the seeds are cultivated. Rice grows on a variety of soils like silts, loams and gravels. 
</p>
          </div>

      </div>
    </section>


<br>
<div class="container">



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Varieties:-</strong> 

There are three thousand varieties of rice in India, out of which some varieties of rice are ready in a short time. Short duration rice varieties mature in 60 to 75 days. IR-5, IR-20, IR-22 and Taichung are prominent among the new seeds of high yielding rice.

</p>







<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Seed quantity for transplanting method:-</strong> 

Healthy seeds should be pruned before sowing. For this, 10 percent salt solution is used. To make a salt solution, dissolve 2.0 kg of common salt in 20 liters of water and add 30 kg of seeds to this solution and stir well.Due to this, healthy and heavy seeds will settle down and thin and light seeds will float to the top. Thus, 20 kg of clean and healthy sorted seed is sufficient to prepare seedlings for planting one hectare in fine grained varieties and 25 kg of seeds in coarse grained varieties.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Treatment :-</strong> 

For seed treatment, dissolve 10 gm Bovistine and 2.5 gm Posamycin or 1 gm Streptocyclin or 2.5 gm Agrimycin in 10 liters of water. Now keep 20 kg of sorted seeds in 25 liters of the above solution for 24 hours. This treatment helps in the control of diseases like root rot, blight and leaf blight disease.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>There are mainly 3 ways of growing rice:-</strong> 
<br>
Terai or paddy cultivation (mostly commercial rice lands around the world). Rice is grown on land that is full of rain or irrigation water. Water depth ranges from 2 to 20 inches (5 to 50 cm).<br>
Floating and deep water rice. Rice is cultivated on such land where there is a lot of water. Water depths exceed 20 inches (50 cm) and can reach up to 200 inches (5 m). Only certain varieties of rice can be grown this way.
<br>
Mountain rice cultivation (very low percentage of rice cultivated land in the world). Rice is grown on flood-free land, and the crop is heavily dependent on rainwater. Natural rainfall is the only way to irrigate these fields. In such a case, we have to keep in mind that there should be continuous rain for 3 to 4 months, which is very important for the proper growth of the plants.
<br>
In general, water protects rice plants from too much cold and heat. Water also prevents weeds from growing.
<br>
</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Suitable Land :-</strong> 

Soils with high water holding capacity such as smooth, matiyar or matiyar-loam are often suitable for paddy cultivation. The pH value of the soil is 5.5 to 6.5. Although paddy can be cultivated in the land having pH value of 4 to 8 or more, but the most suitable soil is considered to be of pH 6.5. Paddy can be grown successfully in alkaline and saline soil by proper use of soil improvers.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Climate :-</strong> 

Paddy is mainly a crop of tropical and sub-tropical climate. Paddy can be grown successfully in all areas where the average temperature is 21C or more for 4 to 6 months. 25 to 30 degree Celsius temperature is suitable for good growth of crop and 20 to 25 degree Celsius temperature is suitable for ripening. The lower the night temperature, the better it is for crop production. But should not fall below 15C.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Field preparation and sowing:-</strong> 
Rice is an adaptable plant that can be grown in almost any type of soil. As long as it is well irrigated (whether through irrigation or rain water), it can grow in both wet and dry fields. However, we expect good yields in our field, so we have to prepare the soil so that it can accept small rice plants (transplant method) or pre-germinated and incubated seeds (direct seeding method).
<br>
Firstly, the rice seeds should be cleaned thoroughly to remove any weeds and unwanted things. Many farmers plow the fields with a plow to till the soil. In addition, harrowing helps to break the pieces of clay into smaller pieces. Land leveling by laser is also a very common activity among commercial rice growers.
<br>
Keep in mind that every farm is different and has different needs. We suggest consulting a local licensed expert for a rational farm preparation plan.
There are two major methods of land preparation, wet preparation, and dry preparation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Wet preparation:</b><br>
Wet preparation is an option for hilly and lowland areas. In this method, the field needs to be prepared with lots of water for future rice cultivation. In this method, the soil is kept filled with water. To prepare the rice field we can keep in mind the following steps.
<br>
Step 1: Build or Repair the Canal. In general, canals help to hold rain water. We can build a 19X12 inch (50X30 cm) canal around the field. Many rice farmers report that the height of each canal is 1,1-1.9 inches (3-5 cm). Its purpose is to ensure the availability of water during the rainy season.
<br>
Step 2: Irrigate the field. After the construction of water canals, many rice farmers irrigate the field for at least a week. This makes the soil smooth, soft and ready for plowing.
<br>
Step 3: Tillage Processes. After adequate irrigation of soil we can do tillage. When the soil is sufficiently wet, it is likely to be ready for plowing.
<br>
Step 4: Filling the field with water. After plowing, rice farmers often water the field for 2 weeks.
<br>
Step 5: Auxiliary tillage procedures. This step is done at least 10 days after the field is filled with water. This includes tilling the field and running the hanga. Soil can be whipped with rotavator and power tiller. The soil becomes like mud. This method can, in general, ensure the conservation and availability of soil nutrients. After this, we can run henga 2-3 more times in the rice field in an interval of 5-7 days.
<br>
Step 6: Leveling the Field. The final stage of wet preparation takes place two days before planting. Tractors or animals can help in this process. A wooden plank attached to them will move across the field leveling it. The flat surface of the soil is also essential for proper growth of crops
<br>
<br>
<b>Dry preparation</b><br>
Dry preparation can be done for both lowland and mountainous fields. This type of preparation requires less water. We can keep in mind the following steps to prepare the rice field.
<br>
Step 1: Build the Canal. As mentioned above, canals help in holding rain water. We can build a 19X12 inch (50X30 cm) canal around the field. Typically, the height of each canal is 1.1-1.9 inches (3-5 cm). Its purpose is to ensure the availability of water during the rainy season.
<br>
Step 2: Tillage Processes. After adequate irrigation of soil we can do tillage.<br>
Step 3: Auxiliary tillage procedures. Farmers often use rototillers to drive henga in the field and plow it.<br>
Step 4: Leveling the field. In dry preparation, we have less amount of water in the field. In this case, we normally don't have to use a wooden plank to level it. Typically, this involves leveling the ground with a laser. Even for good growth of crops, the surface of the soil is also necessary.
<br>
Step 5: Control weeds. A common way to stop the growth of weeds is to allow them to grow for at least two weeks. After they have grown, farmers often use herbicides (always consult a licensed agronomist before using any crop protection product). We must be very careful about any possible herbicide effects.
<br>
</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Fertilizers and Chemical Fertilizers:-</strong> 

Chemical fertilizers in rice cultivation. P.K. - Should be used on the basis of 60:20:24 kg/acre respectively. Also organic manure can be used. Keep in mind that essential nutrients should be used only on the basis of soil test.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Diseases of Rice :-
</strong> 
The spread of diseases depends on temperature and other climatic factors as well as the effect of cropping activities. The main diseases of paddy are divided into three parts on the basis of their factors:

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Fungal disease - </strong> 
<br>
disease caused by fungus<br>
Badra (Blast)<br>
Stem rot<br>
Foot rot & bakanae<br>
Sheath rot<br>
Sheath blight<br>
Brown spot<br>
Virtual Congiari (False smut)<br>
Udbatta<br>

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Bacterial disease</strong> 
<br>
disease caused by bacteria<br>
Bacterial leaf blight<br>
Bacterial leaf streak<br>
Virus disease - disease caused by virus<br>
Tungro<br>
Grassy stunt<br>

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Weed control :-</strong> 

Khurpi or Pedweeder can be used to destroy weed weeds of paddy. Also, in chemical weedicide, Pendimethyl at the rate of 1-1.5 liters / ha can be used 2-3 days after transplanting.

</p>








<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Irrigation :-</strong> 


It is very important to have adequate irrigation facility for paddy crop. If there is adequate irrigation facility, it is very beneficial to keep about 5 to 6 cm of water standing in the field. The maximum amount of water is required in the field at the time of four stages of paddy-transplanting, calving, earing and grain filling. At these conditions, 5 to 6 cm of water must be filled in the field. Irrigation should be stopped by removing water from the field 15 days before harvesting.

</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Harvesting :-</strong> 


The biological cycle (days from sowing to harvest) of rice ranges from 95 days (very early maturing varieties) to about 250 days (very late varieties). Medium maturing varieties can be harvested 120-150 days after sowing. When the grain starts to turn yellow and firm, we are ready to harvest it. The crop can be harvested by hand or by machine. Mechanical harvesting can be done using machines that combine all activities such as harvesting, husking and cleaning.

</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Storage :-</strong> 

Drying is an important process to reduce the moisture content of the grain. After harvesting, the grain usually contains about 25% moisture. If we leave them like this, it can cause the grain to discolor and be attacked by insects. Therefore, in most cases, before storing the grain, farmers dry the grain.
<br>

Although the yield is based on the crop and variety, but the yield of hybrid should be 6.5 to 7 tonnes, 50 to 55 quintals for normal irrigated area and 45 to 50 quintals per hectare for unirrigated area after adopting all the above methods or techniques.
</p>
