A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.

Foliar spray of 3% urea is suitable before flowering in sandy areas.Apart from this, to improve the physical and chemical condition of the soil, it has been found appropriate to give 25 to 30 kg of decomposed manure per plant. For organic manure, in July-August, 250 grams of Azospirillum mixed with 40 kg of cow dung and put in the trays has shown an increase in production.
