          <h2>Inorganic Fertilizer</h2>
         
        </div>

</div>


<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Inorganic fertilizers</strong>
Inorganic fertilizer input is one of the main components of AI (Firbank et al., 2008; Tivy, 1990) with a number of potential direct and indirect effects on biodiversity (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002). Although artificial fertilization clearly contributes to the monopolization of primary production by agriculture, it also increases the global productivity of the system, and thus some mixed responses of biodiversity components might be expected. Geiger et al. (2010a) did not demonstrate any significant effect of inorganic fertilizers on the species richness of vascular plants, carabid beetles or birds. However, Guerrero et al. (2011) focused on the FD of birds using the AGRIPOPES data and showed a positive relationship between the diversity of some functional groups, such as diet type and nesting strategy, and the amount of N fertilizers probably related to the increased productivity of agroecosystems.


</p>


        <div class="row">
          	<div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2">
            		<img src="FERTIPESTI/KY592.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="farmer" style="height:auto;">
			<img src="FERTIPESTI/KY591.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="farmer" style="height:auto;">
          	</div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0 order-2 order-lg-1 content">
          <p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"> 

Studies at particular sites also provided mixed results. Aavik and Liira (2009, 2010) found in Estonian farmland that higher fertilization rates negatively affected small-scale plant species richness among taxa with a high tolerance to agriculture, but also among less tolerant ones (more associated with natural habitats). Such responses could be explained by the enhanced growth of cultivated cereals due to fertilizers, which in turn could favour their ability to monopolize other resources such as light and water, outcompeting weeds and other wild plants. 
<br><br>Guerrero et al. (2010) did not find such effects in the Spanish study area, where no response of arable weeds to the application of N, P and K was observed. These differences might be explained by the high prevalence of agricultural weeds at the Spanish sites, and these species are well adapted to local crop conditions. 
<br><br>It is also likely that farmers apply fertilizers more intensively when sowing at higher density, so that the negative effect of sowing density (see in the following section) might mask the influence of fertilizers. Guerrero et al. (2010) found that carabid species richness was negatively influenced by inorganic N input, but positively affected by applied P. 
<br><br>
Inorganic fertilizers tend to lower soil pH, making it more acidic. Every plant tolerates different soil pH levels, and some plants will do well in acidic soil. However, if the soil gets too acidic, plants will suffer.If only inorganic fertilizer is used, the structure of the soil will degrade.

<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
Previous studies on organic farming have indicated a negative effect of synthetic fertilizers on this group, possibly mediated by decreased prey abundance (e.g. Bengtsson et al., 2005), although the influence of different inorganic nutrients was not examined. The positive effect of P found by Guerrero et al. (2010) could result from an indirect relationship of P with other factors affecting carabids such as sward structure or microclimate (Holland, 2002). In summary, the effect of inorganic fertilizers on biodiversity components is less consistent across taxa and geography than that of other inputs such pesticides, which probably results from differences in local management and landscape configuration.
</p>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;"><strong>Inorganic fertilizers</strong><br>
 are also sometimes referred to as chemical or synthetic fertilizer because their plant-providing nutrients have been synthesized or manufactured in a laboratory or refinery. Until 100 years ago, fertilizers were all organic because the science and chemistry behind inorganic fertilizers had not been developed. However, since then we have learned plants develop well using inorganic nutrients, and these fertilizers offer gardeners several advantages.
</p>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:23px;"><strong><u>Advantages of Inorganic Fertilizer</u></strong><br><br></p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Fast Acting:</b>
One advantage inorganic fertilizers offer is that they are fast acting. These nutrient-rich salts dissolve quickly and are immediately available to the plants depending on them to provide essential nourishment in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In cases when plants show signs of nutrient deficiency, inorganic fertilizers have a distinct advantage over organic choices, which depend on soil organisms to first break down the organic matter before nutrients can be released. This delay can result in plants not receiving required levels of vital nutrients and causing stunted growth, poor fruit and flower development or weak stems. Inorganic fertilizer's fast delivery of essential elements and minerals eliminates this potential problem.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Precise Content:</b>
Another advantage that inorganic fertilizers offer is the precise content of nutrients is guaranteed by law. The breakdown of the plant nutrients is provided as a percentage, which you will commonly see displayed as 12-10-10, 16-6-4 or 10-10-10, for example, on inorganic fertilizer bags or containers. The first number listed is always the percentage of nitrogen, followed by the same for phosphorus and potassium, or N-P-K. Therefore, in a 16-6-4 inorganic fertilizer, 16 percent of the contents is nitrogen, 6 percent is phosphorus and 4 percent is potassium. The precise content of fertilizers is important to know because individual garden soil requirements, as well as specific plant needs, vary. Knowing exactly which nutrients and in what quantities you are adding to the soil will ensure growing plants will have the correct nourishment they'll need for healthy development.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Ease of Use:</b>
Inorganic fertilizers also offer the advantage of coming in several easy-to-use formulations, which also makes them much easier to transport than organic fertilizers like manure. Inorganic fertilizers are available as dry granules, water-soluble powders and liquid concentrates, as well as spikes and tabular formats designed specifically for indoor or garden container plants. Controlled-release inorganic fertilizers dispense plant nutrients over an extended period from three to eight months, eliminating the need for repeated fertilizer applications throughout the growing season an added advantage for busy home gardeners.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Lower Cost:</b>
Because inorganic fertilizers are mass produced, they are less costly than organic fertilizers, which carry a significantly higher expense. In particular, dry granular controlled-release inorganic fertilizers are a very cost-efficient option for home gardeners because they provide complete nutrition and do not require repeated applications.
</p>




<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Pet Friendliness:</b>
Some inorganic fertilizers contain ingredients such as carbamates or organophosphates, which can potentially be dangerous to your pet. You should avoid these if you have dogs or cats. Other inorganic fertilizers are generally pet safe when used as directed.
Paradoxically, organic fertilizers can be more dangerous. They're often derived from meat or fish byproducts and, unlike inorganic fertilizers, these smell remarkably appealing to pets. Given the chance, many pets will eat enough of these products to become very ill indeed.
</p>



<br><br>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:23px;"><strong><u>Disadvantages of Inorganic Fertilizer</u></strong><br><br></p>


<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
There are many advantages and disadvantages of inorganic fertilizers to consider when deciding how to add nutrients to your garden. Inorganic fertilizers usually only contain select nutrients and are quickly and easily absorbed by plants, which allows you to strategically correct any nutrient imbalances indicated in your soil test results. However, there are also many disadvantages to this option, including some negative effects on soil structure and the environment.
</p>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Runoff and Environmental Concerns:</b>
The effect on the environment is a big factor when considering the pros and cons of inorganic fertilizer. Creating inorganic nitrogen fertilizer requires extremely high temperature and pressure. Frontiers for Young Minds notes that the process uses as much as 1 to 2 percent of the world's annual energy supply.The use of inorganic fertilizer also has direct impacts on the local environment where it is used. Only approximately half of the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer is utilized by plants in the area where it is applied. Some of the other 50 percent is released into the atmosphere after microorganisms in the soil convert it to nitrous oxide, a gas that contributes to global warming.In addition, much of it leaches away from rainfall and irrigation. When it leaches into waterways, organisms that thrive on nitrogen and other nutrients in fertilizers grow quickly. As a result, the plants and microorganisms use up the available oxygen in the water, killing off species that rely on that oxygen.
</p>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Soil Structure and pH</b>
Inorganic fertilizers tend to lower soil pH, making it more acidic. Every plant tolerates different soil pH levels, and some plants will do well in acidic soil. However, if the soil gets too acidic, plants will suffer. Fertilizing with manure, an organic option, helps to keep soil pH in a range that is healthy for plants, advises the American Society of Agronomy.In addition to altering soil pH levels, inorganic fertilizers do not contribute to enhancing soil structure. If only inorganic fertilizer is used, the structure of the soil will degrade. One reason for this is that it decreases water-stable aggregates, the particles that stick together and help to decrease water erosion. Manure, on the other hand, increases water-stable aggregates.Manure also increases carbon levels in the soil more than inorganic fertilizer. Carbon contributes to good soil structure.
</p>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
The use of inorganic fertilizer usually requires <b>more frequent</b> fertilization. While the nutrients are readily absorbed by plants, they don't stay in the soil for as long. Using a slow-release fertilizer helps to address this concern, but generally, inorganic fertilizer must be added to the soil frequently, advises Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service. Inorganic fertilizers are often less expensive, but depending on the nutrient levels in your soil, the cost savings may be cancelled out since multiple applications are often needed.
</p>



<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
Since the <b>nutrients are concentrated</b> and readily available, plants are susceptible to being burned or scorched if too much fertilizer is applied. Inorganic fertilizers also increase the possibility of high salinity. Saline soils have too much salt and can negatively affect a plant's ability to absorb nutrients and water. These fertilizers can also cause a crust on top of the soil, advises Oregon State University Extension Service. This can affect water absorption into the soil.
</p>






<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Nutrient Availability</b>
Organic fertilizers release nutrients only when the soil is warm and moist, which tends to correspond with your plants times of greatest need. However, they rely on soil organisms to break down organic matter, so nutrients are released more slowly than they are from inorganic fertilizers. This slow-release method reduces the risk of nutrient leaching, but it takes time to supply nutrients to plants. In contrast, inorganic fertilizers provide this nutrition in plant-ready form immediately. However, the concentration of nutrients increases the risk of burning the plant, and the rapid release of nutrients may leach them deeply into the soil and water table where plants can't access them.
</p>






<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Application</b>
The nutrients and exact elements available from an organic fertilizer, such as manure or compost, can only be guessed at without laboratory testing. This means you're giving an inexact application that may or may not meet your plants needs. By comparison, applying inorganic fertilizers is simple, because the amount of a given element and the rate of application are known.
</p>






<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Cost</b>
Organic fertilizers often cost significantly more than inorganic fertilizers, but over time, this extra cost may be outweighed by the benefits it provides. Organic fertilizers continue to improve the soil long after the plants have taken the nutrients they need. Therefore, the longer your soil is fed with organic fertilizers, the better its composition and texture. So, while inorganic fertilizer is cheaper in the short term, it adds less to the soil in the long term.
</p>





<p align="justify" style="font-size:17px;">
<b>Environmental Impacts</b>
Inorganic fertilizers are immediately available to your plants, but they are subject to leaching, a process that occurs when fertilizers are washed by rain or irrigation water below the level of plant roots. Heavy applications can burn your plants and build up toxic salt concentrations in the soil, which can create chemical imbalances. Organic fertilizer may also build up concentrations of some nutrients, but buildup of toxicity is unlikely as long as the organic material is able to fully decompose.
In addition, because organic fertilizers are made from natural sources, only limited amounts of fossil fuels are used in production. This means greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere is lower in organic fertilizer production than it is in inorganic fertilizer production.
